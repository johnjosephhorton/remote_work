\section{Introduction}
The on-going \covid{} pandemic has confined large numbers of people to their homes via quarntines and shelter-in-place orders.
Many businesses are closed. 
There have already been enormous and unprecendented increases in workers filing unemployment insurance claims \citep{goldsmith2020}. 

We conducted a survey on Google Consumer Surveys to get a sense of individual at-the-moment situation. 

We launched our survey on \SurveyStart{} and collected respondents until \SurveyEnd{}. 
We surveyed a total of \numObs{} respondents.
We asked a single question:
````Have you started to work from home in the last 4 weeks?''
which had the following response options: 

\begin{enumerate} 
\item ``I continue to commute to work''
\item ``I have recently been furloughed or laid-off''
\item ``None of the above / Not working for pay''
\item ``Used to commute, now work from home''   
\item ``Used to work from home and still do''       
\item ``Used to work from home, but now I commute''
\end{enumerate} 

\section{Results}

Of the respondents, \numObsWorking{} reported somethin other than ``None of the above / Not working for pay.''
This gives an implied labor force participation rate of \LFPRhat{}\%, which is lower than the BLS estimate about about 62\%, but still fairly close.
%Some of the ``None of above'' respondents could be unemployed. 
The distribution of answers pooled over all respondents is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:working_summary}. 

In Figure~\ref{fig:working_summary}, we can see that most common response was that they continue to commute, but the next most common was that they were now working from home. 
The working from home fraction is about 35\%. 
This is remarkably close to the estimate from \cite{dingel2020} that 34\% of jobs in the US can plausibly be performed from home.
As we will see, there is some regional variation, though we make no attempt to account for differing regions having different job compositions. 

If we take the US labor force at about 165M, with an 11\% increase in furloughs/lay-offs, the impication is about ~16M recently out of work.
This is still considerably larger than the number who have reportedly filed for UI, as of April 1st, 2020.\footnote{
